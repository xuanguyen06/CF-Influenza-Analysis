# CF-Influenza-Analysis
Assist medical staffing agency in planning for influenza season. Examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to plan for staffing needs across the country. 

## Project Overview
### Motivation:
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequatly treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff. 

### Objective:
Determin when to send staff, and how many, to each state. 

### Scope:
The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

## Success Factors
- A staffing plan that utilizes all available agency staff per state requirements, without necessitating additional resources
- Minimal instances of understaffing and overstaffing across states (a state can be considered understaffed if the staff-to-patient ratio is lower than 90% of the required ratio and overstaffed if greater than 110%)
